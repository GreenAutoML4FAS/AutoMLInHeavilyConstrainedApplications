 Abstract:
>Optimizing a machine learning pipeline for a task at hand requires careful configuration of various hyperparameters, typically supported by an AutoML system that optimizes the hyperparameters for the given training dataset. Yet, depending on the AutoML systemâ€™s own second-order meta-configuration, the performance of the AutoML process can vary significantly. Current AutoML systems cannot automatically adapt their own configuration to a specific use case. Further, they cannot compile user-defined application constraints on the effectiveness and efficiency of the pipeline and its generation. In this paper, we propose Caml, which uses meta-learning to automatically adapt its own AutoML parameters, such as the search strategy, the validation strategy, and the search space, for a task at hand. The dynamic AutoML strategy of Caml takes user-defined constraints into account and obtains constraint-satisfying pipelines with high predictive performance.

We invite the reader to have a look at our paper and the code to reproduce our
results. All details necessary to understand the code and hyperparameter are 
given in the paper.

```

## Run CAML in four lines of code

```python
from fastsklearnfeature.declarative_automl.caml.CAML import CAML

caml = CAML(time_search_budget=60, inference_time_limit=0.001)
caml.fit(X_train, y_train, categorical_indicator)
y_pred = caml.predict(X_test)
```
